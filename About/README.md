# About This Repository.

This repository will be used to keep track of _Project & Portfolio 1_ coding assigned to you throughout this class. This **"About"** folder readme is provided as a quick reference.   

## Coding Challenges

This repository includes a **[Challenges](https://github.com/ePortfolios/dvp1/tree/master/Challenges)** folder that contains your initial coding assignments. 

**Important!**: Attend or review the first Lecture or GoTo meeting **BEFORE** you begin to work on the coding challenges. This way you will understand what is required of you when coding.




## Markdown

Throughout this course, you will be expected to practice using "Markdown" syntax. 

- **Review:** [markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) 

- **Download:** [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) - A markdown text editor
- **Update ReadMe:** Edit the main readme file with your own words

The main readme is located at the top level of this repository. 

Replace all of the main readme text with your own. For example, replace the "Welcome to Project & Portfolio!" headline with your own descriptive title... "C# Coding Challenges", or "Project & Portfolio 1 Work", etc. The title should accurately describe what the repository contains. 

After updating the main headline of the readme, contine to replace the remaining text. Customize the document and use it to explain your ongoing work throughout the month. 

**Make the Best Impression:** Imagine an employer asking to see this work one day. The first thing that employer will see when they visit your repository is this main readme. 

That is why it is so important to update and refine your main readme over time. It reflects the amount of time and effort you spent working on your code. 

**Note:** Your main Readme should contain a descriptive header/title, describe the purpose of your code repository, and also explain each code challenge worked on throughout the month. Be creative with your readme. Remember, it is a reflection of your work. 


## Version Control and Code
