# AgeConvert
A number excercise that will convert a user's age into days, hours, minutes, and seconds. There are multiple ways to do this. Consider each and choose the most appropriate based on the needs of the application.

#### Your code should:
> * Prompt the user for their name and age (separately) 
> * Validate each user input, requesting it again if necessary
> * Display information each time it's entered
> * Use methods to calculate years into days, hours, minutes, and seconds
> * Display calculations to the user


**Note**: *This challenge should be self contained within its own 'AgeConvert' class, making it neccessary only to call it from the menu. Doing so allows for flexibility within the larger application should updates need to be made in the future.* 

##### Example:

```
    _             ___                     _   
   /_\  __ _ ___ / __|___ _ ___ _____ _ _| |_ 
  / _ \/ _` / -_) (__/ _ \ ' \ V / -_) '_|  _|
 /_/ \_\__, \___|\___\___/_||_\_/\___|_|  \__|
       |___/

Welcome to AgeConvert:
To begin, please enter your name...
_John

Thank you John. Now I know this may be personal, but what's your age?
_23

23 years, Fantastic! Next time someone asks, try answering with:
8,395 days -or-
201,480 hours -or-
12,088,800 minutes -or-
725,328,000 seconds

### Extra Challenge (optional)
Making these conversions with only the user's age is not very accurate. There are many ways we could improve this. 

> * Account for leap year
> * Perhaps ask for birthday instead of age
> * Does the user know what time they were born?
