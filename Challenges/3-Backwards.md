# Backwards
A string exercise that completely reverses (mirrored) the order of user entered information. There are multiple ways to do this. Consider each and choose the most appropriate based on the needs of the application.

#### Your code should:
> * Prompt the user for a sentence containing at least 6 words 
> * Validate user input, requesting it again if necessary
> * Display information in the correct order
> * Use a method to reverse the sentence
> * Display information in reversed order


**Note**: *This challenge should be self contained within its own 'Backwards' class, making it neccessary only to call it from the menu. Doing so allows for flexibility within the larger application should updates need to be made in the future.* 

##### Example:

```
  ___          _                       _    
 | _ ) __ _ __| |____ __ ____ _ _ _ __| |___
 | _ \/ _` / _| / /\ V  V / _` | '_/ _` (_-<
 |___/\__,_\__|_\_\ \_/\_/\__,_|_| \__,_/__/

Welcome to Backwards:
To begin, please enter a sentence containing at least 6 words...
_Hello, welcome to DVP1, let's have a great class!

Thank you, you entered the sentence:
Hello, welcome to DVP1, let's have a great class!

Backwards this sentence would read: 
!ssalc taerg a evah s'tel ,1PVD ot emoclew ,olleH
