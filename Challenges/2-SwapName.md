# SwapName
A string exercise that reverses the order of user entered information. There are multiple ways to do this. Consider each and choose the most appropriate based on the needs of the application.

#### Your code should:
> * Prompt the user for their first and last names (separately)  
> * Validate each user input, requesting it again if necessary
> * Each time data is entered save and display the information
> * Send the saved data as an argument to a method that swaps the order
> * Display information in reversed order


**Note**: *This challenge should be self contained within its own 'SwapName' class, making it neccessary only to call it from the menu. Doing so allows for flexibility within the larger application should updates need to be made in the future.* 

##### Example:

```
  ___                  _  _                
 / __|_ __ ____ _ _ __| \| |__ _ _ __  ___ 
 \__ \ V  V / _` | '_ \ .` / _` | '  \/ -_)
 |___/\_/\_/\__,_| .__/_|\_\__,_|_|_|_\___|
                 |_|                       
======================================================================

Welcome to SwapName:
To begin, please enter your first name...
_John

Thank you John, now I will need your last name...
_Smith

Excellent! Your name (John Smith) reversed would be Smith, John.
