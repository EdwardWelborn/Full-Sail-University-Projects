# TempConvert
A number excercise that converts between temperature scales. There are multiple ways to do this. Consider each and choose the most appropriate based on the needs of the application.

#### Your code should:
> * Prompt the user for a Fahrenheit or Celsius temperature
> * Validate the user input, requesting it again if necessary
> * Display information as entered
> * Use methods to convert between the various scales
> * Display conversion to the user


**Note**: *This challenge should be self contained within its own 'TempConvert' class, making it neccessary only to call it from the menu. Doing so allows for flexibility within the larger application should updates need to be made in the future.* 

##### Example:

```
  _____                ___                     _   
 |_   _|__ _ __  _ __ / __|___ _ ___ _____ _ _| |_ 
   | |/ -_) '  \| '_ \ (__/ _ \ ' \ V / -_) '_|  _|
   |_|\___|_|_|_| .__/\___\___/_||_\_/\___|_|  \__|
                |_|

Welcome to TempConvert. Would you like to...
1. Convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius
2. Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit
_1

Ok, what temperature in Fahrenheit would you like to convert?
_72

Excellent! 77˚F would be 25˚C

### Extra Challenge (optional)
While most people across the world use Celsius or Fahrenheit, the science community often uses Kelvin because it is an absolute temperature scale that relates directly to kinetic energy and volume. 

> * Allow for conversion to/from ˚K 
> * User would therefore need to identify both initial and resulting scale
