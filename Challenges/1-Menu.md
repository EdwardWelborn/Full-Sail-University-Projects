###### *DVP1 - Coding Challenges*
---

# Menu
Provide a means for the user to select and run any of the other completed coding challenges. As you complete each challenge, this will offer a way for the user to run it. 

Carefully consider your user and all possible ways in which they could respond. 

#### Your code should:
> * Welcome point for the application 
> * Display a menu of code challenges that can be run
> * Include a message that asks the user to select a challenge
> * Return to the menu after a challenge runs


**Note**: *The menu will need to be called from Main() and call your other challenges. If you are unsure how to do this, focus your research on instantiating objects from a class.*

##### Example Menu:

```
  ___          _        _       _     ___         _    __     _ _
