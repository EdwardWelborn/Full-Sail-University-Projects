This helm of flying was a gift to the 
big kahuna, Ralph.  
History tells us he received the helm
from a very inept sorcerer, so it only 
works, sometimes.

"Look! In the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane,
oh wait, it's just Ralph"

Once equipped the wearer gains the 
ability to fly short distances, sometimes.
Once in awhile the helm will fail, and
the wearer may fall. Good Luck.
