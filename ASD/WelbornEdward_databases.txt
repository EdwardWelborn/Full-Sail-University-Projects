I have watched the creating SQL queries, structured where clauses as well as the sorting results.

I am okay with doing queries as well as the SQL sorting.  It is the other things I am light in. But I am rewatching each video to get a better understanding of what I am
supposed to accomplish.

I will be late on my databases project, I am sorry for the inconvenience.  But I really want to understand the ideas behind the project better and gain a better grade. 
Even though I do understand that being late does hurt my grade.
